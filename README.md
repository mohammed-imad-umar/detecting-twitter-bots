# 🤖 Detecting Twitter Bots using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect automated (bot) accounts on Twitter.  
It uses real Twitter data and extracts key features to differentiate between human and bot accounts.

---

### 🚀 Features
- ✅ Collect and preprocess Twitter user data  
- ✅ Extract features such as tweet frequency, follower/following ratio, and account metadata  
- ✅ Train machine learning classifiers to detect bots  
- ✅ Evaluate model accuracy and performance using test datasets  

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
